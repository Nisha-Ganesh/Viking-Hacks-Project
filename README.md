QuizQuest is an interactive educational tool designed to address the critical issue of student engagement in various learning environments. By gamifying the learning experience across subjects such as math, geography, and general trivia, the project aims to combat the effects of disengagement. The program offers an entertaining approach to education, providing a platform for users to reinforce their knowledge/skills through randomized quizzes. Each section offers a limited number of lives, where incorrect answers lead to a deduction of lives, and users can choose to restart the section or progress to the next one. This mechanism encourages active participation and critical thinking. Moreover, the project fosters a sense of achievement, with correct responses contributing to a score. QuizQuest combines education with entertainment, transforming a traditionally passive learning experience into an engaging and interactive game.
